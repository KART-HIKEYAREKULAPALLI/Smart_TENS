# Smart_TENS
Many People in our daily life are suffering from diabetic neuropathy, acute and chronic pains, or sports injurious which need special care and medication. 
However only medication or Physical Techniques won’t give relief or fast recovery so some methods such as Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) are used by 
physiotherapists to help in relieving the pain and promote healing. Even used to reduce stretch marks and extract the pattern of human stimulus which helps in various studies.
TENS is a process where the electrical signal is penetrated into the body and help relieve pain it’s not only about physical pains recently TENS device called Cefaly was approved 
by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of migraines and even TENS in some cases effective for relieving labor pain. The Smart Transcutaneous 
Electrical Nerve Stimulation device stands apart in providing patterned stimulation, preprogrammed frequencies, and supports various complex simulation patterns. Here this device 
provides interaction with users and machines which helps to extract human stimulus data which helps to study various patterns and implement diverse Machine Learning and Artificial 
Intelligence techniques. All types of electric nerve impulses are produced by this device and can be adjusted to a specific frequency that works for each individual's pain 
tolerance levels.
This device support both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Right now, it has been implemented using Wi-Fi to control TENS which is better and faster than Bluetooth and makes it cost-effective. 
The Smart TENS device is connected to a local network and interacted via a web browser makes it user-friendly.
